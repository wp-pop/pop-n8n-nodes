/**
 * POP Node — main entry point
 *
 * This is the primary node class registered with n8n. It defines the

 * available properties (resource + operation selectors plus all
 * operation-specific fields).
 *
 * Execution is delegated entirely to the router, which dispatches
 * each input item to the correct operation handler based on the
 * selected resource + operation combination.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   Pop.node.ts → router.ts → invoices/<operation>.ts → utils/request.ts
